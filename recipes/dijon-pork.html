        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A honey-mustard marinade gives pork a tangy-sweet punch.
            Charred cabbage and apple make a crunchy side dish.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ head green or red cabbage, cored and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
            <li>2 large apples - cored and sliced into thin wedges</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, divided </li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) pork tenderloins </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse-grain Dijon-style mustard </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons honey </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place 1 rack in center position and another 4 inches from broiler. Spray a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Toss together cabbage and apples with 3 tablespoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on prepared sheet pan and arrange in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Pat pork dry and season with remaining teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons oil with mustard, vinegar, honey, and thyme in a small bowl. Spread over all sides of pork and set pork on top of cabbage and apples.</li>
            <li>Roast on center rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of thickest part of each tenderloin registers 130 degrees F, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from oven and turn oven to broil. When broiler is hot, put pan on top rack and broil until pork has a golden-brown crust, thermometer registers 145 degrees F, and cabbage and apples have a light char, about 5 minutes.
                Cover pan loosely with foil and let pork rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve pork warm with cabbage and apples, sprinkled with parsley (if using).</li>
        </ol>
